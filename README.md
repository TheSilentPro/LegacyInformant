# Informant
Informs you of plugin updates via discord

# Usage
Informant is a plugin and should be placed in the /plugins folder

## Developers
You only need to add `spigot-id` to your plugin.yml and informant will be able to pick up your plugin automatically.

## Server Owners
For any plugins that do not have automatic checks, you will need to add them in the config.yml plugin under the `plugins` section!
<br>
The format is `ID:NAME`  <br>
Name is from the `/plugins` command. <br>

Where ID is the spigot id of the resource which can be found in the url of their page. <br> 
For example the plugin below has the ID: 84967. That is the number after the dot. <br>
